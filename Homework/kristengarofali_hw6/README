To run, first make sure you are in the correct directory (kristengarofali_hw6), then type ```python crossvalidate5.py data.out 5 1 2```,
where inputs are data.out (file containing data), 5 (k-value), 1 (slope, a), and 2 (intercept, b).

Average MSE from part (a):
9.53

Answer to part (b):
Another choice of model is a polynomial of higher order. The k-fold cross validation could be repeated
for polynomials of different orders.

Note: requires numpy
